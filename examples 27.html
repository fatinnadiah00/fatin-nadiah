You have just seconds to convince the user not to abandon your site. The main message is one of the most prominent elements on the homepage, and if it doesn't appeal to users within those precious few seconds, they are going to bounce. So how do you write a main message that compels users to stay on your site longer than a few seconds?
Firstly, communicate what your brand does. For example, have you ever landed on a website, read the main message and realized you have no idea what the company actually does? Unfortunately this happens a lot in the B2B space, where eagerness to sound professional and knowledgeable results in a heavy reliance on jargon and marketing speak. Your main message has to clearly state what services or products your company sells. Tell it like it is, and avoid vague and generic marketing language.</em></p></center>
<center><p><em>Then, make sure to include a value proposition. In addition to communicating what it is you do, your main messaging must also tell users how what you do or what you sell can positively impact their lives otherwise known as a value proposition. The most compelling messaging speaks the product's ability to solve a problem or fulfill a desire.</em></p><center>
<center><p><em>Last but not least, should be remembered to put the focus on the user. You want to communicate both your brand's purpose and your value, but the trick is to do so in a way that focuses on the user's needs. You could say, "Our yoga mats are professionally engineered to reduce slip," and the user will get a clear picture of what kind of products you sell. But the message becomes even more compelling when the same central idea is instead framed as a benefit to the user: "Yoga mats engineered to give you stay-put performance, no matter the posture." Framing benefits around value to the consumer helps them better understand why they need your products or services.</em></p></center>
