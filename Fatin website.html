		<h6>Quotes of the day-

		Just being yourself, not others!

		Being a pretty is a subjective, but the true beauty is inside and outside us. STOP judging yourself my dear :) KEEP LOVING YOURSELF! You do not have to feel insecure with others' beauty because everyone has their own identity, strength and also weakness. Everyone is not perfect. You will see your own true beauty when you start loving yourself than others! ;)

		BEING GRATEFUL ON WHAT YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU LOSE THEM!!</h6>
