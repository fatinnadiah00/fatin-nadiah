<p><h3><font color="blue"><i>According to Karl Weick, the most effective way to cope with this situation is to adopt a small wins approach.</i></font></h3></p>

<p><h3><font color="blue"><i>According to Weick, a small win refers to a concrete, complete, implemented outcome of moderate importance. So by itself, one small win may seem unimportant. A series of wins at small but significant tasks, however, reveals a pattern that may attract allies, deter opponents, and lower resistance to subsequent proposals.</i></font></h3></p>

<p><h3><font color="blue"><i>According to Karl Weik, forces are set in motion that favor another small win once a small win has been accomplished. When a solution is put in a place, the next solvable problem often becomes more visible. This occurs because new allies has brought new solutions with them and old opponents changed their habits. Additional resources also flow toward winners which means that slightly larger wins can be attempted.</i></font></h3></p>

<p><center><h3><font color="black"><b>I believe that the small wins approach is a very powerful one. It can be applied with great success to innovation, change, strategy, productivity, engagement and leadership.</b></font></h3></center></p>
